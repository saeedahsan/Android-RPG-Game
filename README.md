This is a text-based role playing game made using Android Studio. The user is given a prompt, and makes decisions based on the situation. The story and options are stored in a binary tree and are loaded when GameActivity is first opened. A SharedPreferences is used to automatically save the user's progress in the story, so they can continue from where they left off. Also, the text is presented using the TypingEffect class, which gives the text a typing effect when it appears on screen. The font for this TypingEffect class is a free, downloadable font.
